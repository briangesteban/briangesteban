# Hi! I'm Brian 👋
## A seasoned Multimedia Designer and aspiring Developer
Before I transition to Software Engineering, I've been in the industry of Multimedia
for more than 5 years. It's my passion to develop websites wayback on my university days, back in the Philippines.
When I migrated to Canada, I've decided to take my passion for development in to a higher-level.
I've took a Software Engineering diploma @BrainStation, and now I'm in the process of developing and 
broadening the new skills and experience I've acquired.
